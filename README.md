## Detailed (but summarized/non-exhaustive) directory content descriptions

Below, the sections will discuss the specific tools/functions contained within each directory.  Relevant data domain(s) will be designated below general-form function name.  Toolkit designations (i.e. "wma_[function name]", for white matter anatomy, and "bsc_[function name]", for bloomington script compilation) are dropped when designating function names.  "Version descrepancies/differences will not be discussed.  Higher numbered versions should be presumed to be the latest iteration of a tool/function.

### Analysis

This directory contains several functions/tools which are generally used to compute derived statistics or summaries from other data objects (i.e. CSVs and tractomes/[white matter classification (WMC) structures](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b))

#### ConnectomeTestQ
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography
A connectome quality test.  
A function which computes moderately obscure quantative features of streamlines from an input tract (or tractome).

#### csvTables2DataStruc (csv, general data)
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

A function for merging multiple 2-D data tables into a 3-D data structure.  It is assumed that the individual csv tables are storing information in rougly identical layouts (i.e. subject data).  Robust against row ("Domain") and column ("Property") droppage (i.e. absence in some files).  Essentially designed to amalgamate subject level data (ostensibly stored in distinct csv files) into a group level data structure.  Possibly a hacky variant of a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) function/method.

#### feAndAFQqualityCheck
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography
 
A function for visualizing (for a single tractome/[LiFE input](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844)) **many** quantative tractography traits.  Adaptively alters analyses, quantative output, and figure layout depending on input.  If optional [LiFE structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844) and/or [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) are input, will generate statistics specific to those structures as well (i.e. "surviving streamlines" and "white matter tracts", respectively) and the combination thereof (surviving streamlines in segmented white matter tracts).  [quantAllWMNorm](#quantallwmnorm) and [quantWBFG](quantwbfg) constitute workhorse functions.  
See [this readme](https://github.com/brainlife/app-tractographyQualityCheck/tree/1.2) for an explicit listing, description, and code linkage of each quantative feature computed.

#### normalizeStatMeasures_pathsVersion
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

Computes group-level normalized statistics for all rows ("Domains") and columns ("Properties") in a multi-subject (i.e. csv) dataset.  Cross-subject average computed with [tableAverages](#tableaverages).  Associated with functionality of [csvTables2DataStruc](csvtables2datattruc).  Likely a hacky version of a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or SQL function/method.

#### plotZscoreMeasuresFromCSV
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

Essentially (though not actually), computes, saves, and plots the Z-score normalized output of [normalizeStatMeasures_pathsVersion](#normalizestatmeasures_pathsversion) . Good for publication figure generation.  Optional inputs **plotProperties** and **subSelect** allow for selection of particular rows ("Domains") and columns ("Properties") (and combinations thereof) for plotting/computation.

#### streamlineGeometryPriors
Relevant data domain(s):  (tractography)

Runs the analysis performed by [ConnectomeTestQ](#connectometestq) in order to create a [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) for both the [_Asymmetry Ratio_](#connectometestq) and [_Efficiency Ratio_](#connectometestq) , wherein the distinct streamline identification categories contained within the [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) constitute the .05 incrimented bins of those quantative features (thus resulting in 20 distinct streamline categories per structure).  Intended to be used as a biological/geometric prior for segmentation algorithms.

#### bsc_tableAverages
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

Workhorse function for computing averages across tables with roughly identical data layouts (i.e. subject data).  Robust against row ("Domain") and column ("Property") droppage (i.e. absence in some files).  Likely a hacky version of a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or SQL function/method.

#### endpointMapsDecay
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography

Generates [smoothed/inflated](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/smooth3.html) NIfTI **density** (i.e. count) masks **for the streamline endpoints** of tracts identified in the input [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  Requires a reference NIfTI (to establish mask NIfTI dimensions) and a refrence tract/tractome (to extract identified streamlines from).  Relies on **endpointClusterProto** in order to ensure streamline endpoints are associated with appropriate endpoint group/NIfTI output.  Workhorse function for **[classifiedStreamEndpointCortex]**

#### quantAllWMNorm
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography

Quantifies more common quantative traits associated with white matter.  Underwrites [feAndAFQqualityCheck](#feandafqqualitycheck).  [quantAllWMNorm](#quantallwmnorm) is predicated upon the assumption of an associated [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) and computes a number of stats relative to the (presumed) source whole-brain tractome.  This is as opposed to [quantWBFG](#quantwbfg) which makes no presumptions regarding associated [white matter classification (WMC) structures](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  
See [this readme](https://github.com/brainlife/app-tractographyQualityCheck/tree/1.2) for an explicit listing, description, and code linkage of each quantative feature computed.

#### quantWBFG
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography

The standalone quantification function for a singleton (presumed whole-brain tractome) tract structure.  Quantifies more common quantative traits associated with white matter.  Associated with [quantAllWMNorm](#quantallwmnorm).  
See [this readme](https://github.com/brainlife/app-tractographyQualityCheck/tree/1.2) for an explicit listing, description, and code linkage of each quantative feature computed.

### Atlas_tools

This directory contains a number of tools and functions for working with NIfTI atlases/parcellations.

#### computeAtlasStats

This function iterates across the unique label values (presumed integer, as would be the case for an atlas; bad things would happen for continuous float NIfTI) found in a NIfTI and computes the following statistics

| Quantity label       | Description

[![Run on Brainlife.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Brainlife-bl.app.272-blue.svg)](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.272)  
(although this app is specific to [freesurfer output](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58cb22c8e13a50849b25882e) this function can be run on any [atlas/parcellation](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5c1a7489f9109beac4a88a1f)

#### computeFresurferStats

A precursor to [computeAtlasStats](#computeatlasstats), which takes a [freesurfer directory](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview) as input (and thereby only works on "aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz", assuming it exists, which it doesn't by default, due to the default .mgz output) and computes a subset of the same quantative features (e.g. no actual volume, centroid, or boxyness).

#### inflateLabels

A freesurfer-specific, "aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz" [grey](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/bsc_inflateLabels.m#L22)/[subcortical](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/bsc_inflateLabels.m#L23)-specific inflation function which inflates gray and subcortical labels into the white matter.  Useful for preprocessing the fs_a2009_aseg for subsequent use in segmentation, particularly in the case of tractography generation algorithms which do not guarentee termination in grey / subcortical structures (e.g. mrtrix2).  Relies on modified versions of [fnDeislandLabels](fndeislandlabels), originally written by [Brent McPherson](https://github.com/bcmcpher)
Could theoretically be adapted to work with other pacellations assuming the provision of distinct grey and white matter mask inputs.

#### inflateRelabelIslands

A "user ready" (i.e. no user speficication of parameters, with an important caviot), atlas-general (i.e. not specific to freesurfer) function which detects and relabels parcellation islands (label subsections which are not connected to the largest, contiguous label component).  Important caviot is that the input parcellation cannot feature the label 999, which is used as a [trash label](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/bsc_inflateRelabelIslands.m#L32) in this function.  [Could and should be fixed in future versions (i.e. -1)](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/issues/21).

#### fnDeislandLabels

A modified version of the fnDeislandLabels code originally written by [Brent McPherson](https://github.com/bcmcpher), adapted for current author's norms.  essentially the same as [inflateRelabelIslands](#inflaterelabelislands), except that it doesn't specify the [maxisleSize](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/fnDeislandLabels_v3.m#L17) and ["trash label" (replaceVal)](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/fnDeislandLabels_v3.m#L20), which must be provided by the user.

#### getAsegFile

A utility function which loads one of the .aseg parcellation options ('orig' or '2009') output from [freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).  If the .nii.gz version of the parcellation isn't found, this function will attempt to use [mri_convert](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_convert).  As such, some of the adaptive functionality of this function is predicated upon freesurfer/freeview being installed on the local file structure.

### ClassificationStruc_Tools

The **ClassificationStruc_Tools** directory contains functions which are used for generating, modifying and/or interacting with [white matter classification (WMC) structures](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).

#### concatClassificationCriteria

This function essentially applies a logical _and_ operation across a set of input boolean vectors (each with length equal to the number of streamlines in the structure associated with the source tractogram) and creates a new entry in the input [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) using the specified name.  The presumption/use case for this is that the input boolean vectors represent a number of criteria that have been applied to a sourcetractogram such that the TRUE values are associated with streamlines that meet the criteria and FALSE values do not.  In this way, the resultant tract classification added to the classification structure represents those streamlines which meet all criteria.  This function exists because not all criteria used in segmentation are based on the standard ROI intersection method.

#### extractClassification

This function creates a new classification structure with the **only** tract labeled being the specified tract or index.  The use case for this is to avoid  having to pass around segmented tracts in order to modify them.  Instead you pass around the whole tractogram and the classification structure.  Allows for lightweight tract representation and non-duplication of streamlines

#### extractStreamIndByName

This function to a extract boolean vector indexing the the streamlines associated with the associated string label.  Used to improve robustness and facilitate error handling.  Outputs only a boolean vector, not a [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b)

#### makeFGsFromClassification

Extremely important/useful function which creates a stucture containing *all* of the identified/labeled streamline groups contained within a classification structure.  This facilitates secondary uses like postprocessing, plotting, or other visualization/analysis.  
NOTE: the output tractStruc is a structure wherein each row corresponds to a diffrent classification group. Previous versions of this function added a layer of complexity to this, such there were .fg and .name fields.  This was redundant because there is a .name field within .fg by default.  As such, this is now just a basic [cell structure](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/cell-arrays.html) (wherein each cell contains a distinct "fg object"), and thus there are no fields.

#### makeWBFGandClassFromList

Conceptually, this function is the inverse of [makeFGsFromClassification](makefgsfromclassification).  Instead of generating separate tract structures/files from an input tractome and [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b), this function takes in a list of [.tck format files](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5dcf0047c4ae28d7f2298f48) and combines them into a single tract structure ([vistasoft](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft) fg format) and also creates a corresponding classification structure which identifies the inherited tract identies of the new structure's streamlines.  Used to convert from use cases wherein distinct tracts are stored as separate file objects.

#### mergeFGandClass

This function merges input fiber goups and classification structures.  A deceptively complicated function which relies on [reconcileClassifications](#reconcileclassifications), [spliceClassifications](#spliceclassifications) to handle subtly distinct use cases.   
Example use cases:

- 1.  Merging a tracking parameter sweep:  If you have several different fiber groups generated by different tractography parameter settings, this will provide a merged fg structure along with a classification structure indicating which streamlines came from which source tractography method (as specified by the file name input)

-  2.  Merging multiple segmentations:  By inputting multiple source whole brain fiber groups (from the same subject, one assumes), along with the classification structure from each corresponding segmentation, you can create a "merged replication segmentation" which presumably has more streamlines representing each
 particular tract, or better represents distinct sets of tracts (e.g. if tailored source tractography methods were used).
 
-  3.  Incorporating tracts generated from other methods into an exsting whole brain fiber group and segmentation:  if one already has a whole brain tractome (and corresponding segmentation) it is possible to "append" more tracts to the source tractome and classification structure.  The tracts to be appended *do not need corresponding classification structures* and will be added to the existing classification structure (the one that corresponds to the whole brain tractography, should it exist).  Their names will be derived from the name in the fg.name field.

#### reconcileClassifications

This function is for reconciling two [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  In reconciling, the presumption is that these correspond to the **same** source tractography entities (i.e. collections of streamlines / source tractogram) _but the entities classified be the WMC structure could be the same or different in the two input structures_.

#### spliceClassifications

This function is for splicing two [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  When splicing, the presumption is that these correspond to **separate** tractography entities (i.e. collections of streamlines), _but which may nonetheless correspond to the same anatomical (and thus the same named) structure_ .

#### resortClassificationStruc

This function resorts an input [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) such that left and right variants of a tract are next to eachother.  Future versions may attempt to sort singleton tracts to the front and subcategories (i.e. interhemispheric or ufibers) in an additional fashion.

#### classificationStrucGrouping

Conceptually similar to [resortClassificationStruc](resortclassificationstruc), but merges them into a non-hemisphere specific category.  Uses a more birtle method than [resortClassificationStruc](resortclassificationstruc), [likely needs update](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/issues/22)

#### removeOutliersClassification

A [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b)-specific implementation of [mbaComputeFibersOutliers](https://github.com/francopestilli/mba/blob/master/compute/mbaComputeFibersOutliers.m), a cleaning method for tracts which removes streamlines that are some number of deviations to long or too far away from the tract centroid.  Iterates across the tract identies contained within the [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) and performs the cleaning step with the same parameter settings for all.

#### clearNonvalidClassifications

Using a pairing of a [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) and a [LiFE structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844) this function removes those streamlines from the classification labeling schema such that only those streamlines with evidence maintain their identity.

### Debug_Tools

The functions contained within the **Debug_Tools** directory are useful for interactive segmentation and segmentation diagnostics

#### plotEndpointsOnFG

A plotting function that plots a collection of streamlines (entered as an FG) along with their endpoints and midpoints (in separate colors)

#### plotROIandFG

This function plots both a fiber group and an ROI in the same reference space.  Helpful for identifying proximity of an ROI to streamlines.

#### quickPlot

Lightweight streamline plotting function that undelies the streamline debugging visualizations.

#### quickPlotClassByName

iterates across the entries in a [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) and quickly plots the associated structures.  Good for doing QC on a segmentation.  Be wary of using this on a classification structure with a large number of categories/names.
