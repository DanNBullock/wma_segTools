## Detailed (but summarized/non-exhaustive) directory content descriptions

Below, the sections will discuss the specific tools/functions contained within each directory.  Relevant data domain(s) will be designated below general-form function name.  Toolkit designations (i.e. "wma_[function name]", for white matter anatomy, and "bsc_[function name]", for bloomington script compilation) are dropped when designating function names.  "Version descrepancies/differences will not be discussed.  Higher numbered versions should be presumed to be the latest iteration of a tool/function.

### Analysis

This directory contains several functions/tools which are generally used to compute derived statistics or summaries from other data objects (i.e. CSVs and tractomes/[white matter classification (WMC) structures](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b))

#### ConnectomeTestQ
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography
A connectome quality test.  
A function which computes moderately obscure quantative features of streamlines from an input tract (or tractome).

#### csvTables2DataStruc (csv, general data)
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

A function for merging multiple 2-D data tables into a 3-D data structure.  It is assumed that the individual csv tables are storing information in rougly identical layouts (i.e. subject data).  Robust against row ("Domain") and column ("Property") droppage (i.e. absence in some files).  Essentially designed to amalgamate subject level data (ostensibly stored in distinct csv files) into a group level data structure.  Possibly a hacky variant of a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) function/method.

#### feAndAFQqualityCheck
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography
 
A function for visualizing (for a single tractome/[LiFE input](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844)) **many** quantative tractography traits.  Adaptively alters analyses, quantative output, and figure layout depending on input.  If optional [LiFE structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844) and/or [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) are input, will generate statistics specific to those structures as well (i.e. "surviving streamlines" and "white matter tracts", respectively) and the combination thereof (surviving streamlines in segmented white matter tracts).  [quantAllWMNorm](#quantallwmnorm) and [quantWBFG](quantwbfg) constitute workhorse functions.  
See [this readme](https://github.com/brainlife/app-tractographyQualityCheck/tree/1.2) for an explicit listing, description, and code linkage of each quantative feature computed.

#### normalizeStatMeasures_pathsVersion
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

Computes group-level normalized statistics for all rows ("Domains") and columns ("Properties") in a multi-subject (i.e. csv) dataset.  Cross-subject average computed with [tableAverages](#tableaverages).  Associated with functionality of [csvTables2DataStruc](csvtables2datattruc).  Likely a hacky version of a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or SQL function/method.

#### plotZscoreMeasuresFromCSV
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

Essentially (though not actually), computes, saves, and plots the Z-score normalized output of [normalizeStatMeasures_pathsVersion](#normalizestatmeasures_pathsversion) . Good for publication figure generation.  Optional inputs **plotProperties** and **subSelect** allow for selection of particular rows ("Domains") and columns ("Properties") (and combinations thereof) for plotting/computation.

#### streamlineGeometryPriors
Relevant data domain(s):  (tractography)

Runs the analysis performed by [ConnectomeTestQ](#connectometestq) in order to create a [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) for both the [_Asymmetry Ratio_](#connectometestq) and [_Efficiency Ratio_](#connectometestq) , wherein the distinct streamline identification categories contained within the [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) constitute the .05 incrimented bins of those quantative features (thus resulting in 20 distinct streamline categories per structure).  Intended to be used as a biological/geometric prior for segmentation algorithms.

#### bsc_tableAverages
Relevant data domain(s):  csv, general data

Workhorse function for computing averages across tables with roughly identical data layouts (i.e. subject data).  Robust against row ("Domain") and column ("Property") droppage (i.e. absence in some files).  Likely a hacky version of a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or SQL function/method.

#### endpointMapsDecay
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography

Generates [smoothed/inflated](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/smooth3.html) NIfTI **density** (i.e. count) masks **for the streamline endpoints** of tracts identified in the input [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  Requires a reference NIfTI (to establish mask NIfTI dimensions) and a refrence tract/tractome (to extract identified streamlines from).  Relies on **endpointClusterProto** in order to ensure streamline endpoints are associated with appropriate endpoint group/NIfTI output.  Workhorse function for **[classifiedStreamEndpointCortex]**

#### quantAllWMNorm
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography

Quantifies more common quantative traits associated with white matter.  Underwrites [feAndAFQqualityCheck](#feandafqqualitycheck).  [quantAllWMNorm](#quantallwmnorm) is predicated upon the assumption of an associated [white matter classification (WMC) structure](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b) and computes a number of stats relative to the (presumed) source whole-brain tractome.  This is as opposed to [quantWBFG](#quantwbfg) which makes no presumptions regarding associated [white matter classification (WMC) structures](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5cc1d64c44947d8aea6b2d8b).  
See [this readme](https://github.com/brainlife/app-tractographyQualityCheck/tree/1.2) for an explicit listing, description, and code linkage of each quantative feature computed.

#### quantWBFG
Relevant data domain(s):  tractography

The standalone quantification function for a singleton (presumed whole-brain tractome) tract structure.  Quantifies more common quantative traits associated with white matter.  Associated with [quantAllWMNorm](#quantallwmnorm).  
See [this readme](https://github.com/brainlife/app-tractographyQualityCheck/tree/1.2) for an explicit listing, description, and code linkage of each quantative feature computed.

### Atlas_tools

This directory contains a number of tools and functions for working with NIfTI atlases/parcellations.

#### computeAtlasStats

This function iterates across the unique label values (presumed integer, as would be the case for an atlas; bad things would happen for continuous float NIfTI) found in a NIfTI and computes the following statistics

| Quantity label       | Description

[![Run on Brainlife.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Brainlife-bl.app.272-blue.svg)](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.272)  
(although this app is specific to [freesurfer output](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58cb22c8e13a50849b25882e) this function can be run on any [atlas/parcellation](https://brainlife.io/datatype/5c1a7489f9109beac4a88a1f)

#### computeFresurferStats

A precursor to [computeAtlasStats](#computeatlasstats), which takes a [freesurfer directory](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/OutputData_freeview) as input (and thereby only works on "aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz", assuming it exists, which it doesn't by default, due to the default .mgz output) and computes a subset of the same quantative features (e.g. no actual volume, centroid, or boxyness).

#### inflateLabels

A freesurfer-specific, "aparc.a2009s+aseg.nii.gz" [grey](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/bsc_inflateLabels.m#L22)/[subcortical](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/bsc_inflateLabels.m#L23)-specific inflation function which inflates gray and subcortical labels into the white matter.  Useful for preprocessing the fs_a2009_aseg for subsequent use in segmentation, particularly in the case of tractography generation algorithms which do not guarentee termination in grey / subcortical structures (e.g. mrtrix2).  Relies on modified versions of [fnDeislandLabels](fndeislandlabels), originally written by [Brent McPherson](https://github.com/bcmcpher)
Could theoretically be adapted to work with other pacellations assuming the provision of distinct grey and white matter mask inputs.

#### inflateRelabelIslands

A "user ready" (i.e. no user speficication of parameters, with an important caviot), atlas-general (i.e. not specific to freesurfer) function which detects and relabels parcellation islands (label subsections which are not connected to the largest, contiguous label component).  Important caviot is that the input parcellation cannot feature the label 999, which is used as a [trash label](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/bsc_inflateRelabelIslands.m#L32) in this function.  [Could and should be fixed in future versions (i.e. -1)](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/issues/21).

#### fnDeislandLabels

A modified version of the fnDeislandLabels code originally written by [Brent McPherson](https://github.com/bcmcpher), adapted for current author's norms.  essentially the same as [inflateRelabelIslands](#inflaterelabelislands), except that it doesn't specify the [maxisleSize](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/fnDeislandLabels_v3.m#L17) and ["trash label" (replaceVal)](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/3bab47ab121c273e43e1f2fb48647c41e66bfb00/Atlas_tools/fnDeislandLabels_v3.m#L20), which must be provided by the user.

#### getAsegFile

A utility function which loads one of the .aseg parcellation options ('orig' or '2009') output from [freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).  If the .nii.gz version of the parcellation isn't found, this function will attempt to use [mri_convert](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_convert).  As such, some of the adaptive functionality of this function is predicated upon freesurfer/freeview being installed on the local file structure.
